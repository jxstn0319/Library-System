## Description of the Proposed Software/System:
A system called the library system allows users to browse and borrow books, and it has a feature that tracks who is borrowing what to ensure the safety of the books. Both administrators and users can log in, and administrators can add or delete books from the library's inventory while users can browse and borrow books.
## Objectives:
The systemâ€™s objective is to provide service to users that want to read books without spending money.
## Specific Objectives: 
-	Provide quality books
-	Add user-requested books
-	Let users borrow a book for as long as 1 month
## Scopes: 
- Log-in system
  1. Admin - Can add/remove books
  2. Guest - Can browse/borrow a maximum of 2 books for as long as 1 month.
-	Add/remove books system for admins
-	Browse/borrow books system for guests 
## Delimitations:
-	No permanent database is used (Admin needs to add the books before Guests can read them. This is done every use of the program.)
-	Guests can only borrow a maximum of 2 books
-	Guests can only borrow books for as long as 1 month
